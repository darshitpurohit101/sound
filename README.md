# sound classification

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify sounds as either violent or non-violent. Which can be extremely useful in alerting the authorities and enabling them to take quick action in emergency situations. As an input it takes an audio which can be recorded using microphone, then this audio is cleaned off for background noises and silence is timed of the audio. Final output consists
of arrays which have probability factors. It fires a notification when it encounters a violent
noise.

## Technology used

Pandas , Matplotlib , NumPy , SciPy , Scikit , Keras, TensorFlow, Librosa 

### Steps to execute
Put all the files into same folder and execute model.py it will generate a model and save it as 'Sound_Classification_Model.cpkt'.
Use that model to predict.
X is Input file with audio arrays and Y is containing output i.e. labels corresponding to X
